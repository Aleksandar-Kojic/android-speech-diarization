This project is now longer under development, but it's here for anyone 
interested. If you try to run the project on a device, you will eventually hit
an error related to a missing 'config.xml' file. Place it into the root 
directory of your device to actually run this project (I think it's the root 
directory, you can look through the code to check where it expects to read this
 file from ...)
