Supervised by Professor Jonathan Rose (University of Toronto), the development of this Android application was the subject of an undergraduate thesis in electrical and computer engineering. Essentially, the app 'listens' to a conversation between N speakers, and calculates which speaker spent what percentage of time speaking. This type of audio signal processing is referred to as "Speech Diarization", and historically has been used to answer the question "who spoke when" in a conversation.
